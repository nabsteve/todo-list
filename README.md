# todo-list
A sample to do list, complete with NOSQL Database using Mongoose and MongoDB. 

The app works by generating 3 default items on the default page which is "Today".
You can create other lists by adding "/customName" after the localhost address. This creates a new collection where list items would be saved to the database and deleted.

Checking the box to the left of items delete them from specific list which they were.

The implementation of the app is purely on the local system.
It's hosted on localhost:3000 and database on on mongoDB locally.
